Yet Another Network Emulator !?

Yes !


--------------------------------------------------------------------

* General structure

   A real mess !

- Loading the network

   This is done by a specific function (see later)

- Booting the network

   Creation of the multiple parts of the network (hosts, bridges,
links, ...)


* Configuration

   A function has to build the network (ie data structures describing
the network). For this, it needs to build the following variables

   bridgeInterfaces is an array (indexed by bridge names) of
BridgeInterface

* Data structure syntax

. BridgeInterface

   ! separated list of interface list

example
   host-a:v0!host-b:v0!host-c:v0

. Point to point link

   i1!i2

where
   i1 is one interface
   i2 is another interface
   
. Interface

   h:i[:A]

where
   h is the host
   i os the interface name within the host
   a is an IPv4 address

example
   host-a:v0:192.168.10.2/24
